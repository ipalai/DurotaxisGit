Durotaxis of passive nanoparticles on elastic membranes
ACS Nano 15, 15794 (2021)
https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.01.438065

It contains code to compute the free energy of a passive nanoparticle adhering to a fluctuating, bendable membrane. 
First, adhesion energy, bending energy, global stretching, and fluctuation entropy are defined as a function of wrapped area (see Methods section of the paper). 
Then, the constrained free energy resulting from the sum of these terms is minimised, and the equilibrium free energy (see Fig. 3) is output to a file.

The code is given in its original .nb format (Mathematica notebook). For readability, it has also been converted to .m and .pdf format.
